It has dynamic prompt generation capabalities where the prompt is given based on the same criteria mentionned above. This is to optimize the quality and relevancy of the output.

The LLM used for content generation is LLaMa 3, invoked using Langchain and Ollama. This can be modfied to use any other LLM.
